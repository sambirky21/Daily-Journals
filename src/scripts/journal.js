// From journal entry 2, oops got ahead of ourselves. We were supposed to make each object have it's very own variable. And then add each of those variables into the array. I defined one variable and within that array, I added each object which made things a bit redundant.

// Your learning objective in this chapter is to set up JSON Server to store the data for your daily journal entries, query that data from the API, and then use your knowledge of Promises (remember, fetch is a fancy Promise) and then() to render the entries to the DOM.
